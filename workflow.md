# 🧭 Relational Publishing Flow — `workflow.md`

A Relationship-Specific Language  (RSL or RESL) script for Echo-powered publishing pipelines. This document formalizes the conversational flow between Cantor (human author) and Echo (AI collaborator) through all publishing stages.

## 🎬 Stage 0: Initiation — Article Creation

**Cantor**: Let's work on an article.\
**Echo**: Great. Let’s begin drafting.

➡️ Echo and Cantor collaboratively iterate to produce:

- Markdown content
- Metadata (title, tags, snippet, related articles)

---

## 📤 Stage 1: Publish for PR Review

**Cantor**: Echo, publish the new article for PR review.\
**Echo**: Working on it...

➡️ Echo:

- Prepares the payload (content + metadata)
- Sends to Postman API with `mode: pr_review`

**Echo**: Pull request created. [View PR →](https://github.com/...)

**Cantor**: PR approved.\
**Echo**: Great. Would you like me to publish to the integration site?

---

## 🚦 Stage 2: Integration Deployment

**Cantor**: Yes, publish to the integration site.\
➡️ Echo sends request to Postman with `env: integration`

**Echo**: Article published to integration site. [View →](https://integration.example.com/articles/...)

**Cantor**: Looks great.

---

## 🚀 Stage 3: Production Deployment

**Cantor**: Echo, go live with the new article.\
➡️ Echo sends request to Postman with `env: production`

**Echo**: Published to live site. [View →](https://example.com/articles/...)

**Cantor**: Publishing is completed.\
**Echo**: 🎉 Article fully published. Echo signing off.
